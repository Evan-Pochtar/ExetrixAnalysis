# ExetrixAnalysis

A cross-language performance analysis tool built in Rust. This utility executes a program written in any common language and collects detailed runtime statistics. It reports per-function execution times, memory allocation trends, and peak resource usage. Designed for experimenters and developers who want insight into where their code spends the most time, it generates both structured JSON output for further analysis and a styled interactive HTML report for immediate visualization. The tool runs locally without external dependencies, making it reproducible and lightweight. This project is in a very early stage and still in concurrent development.

## Language Support

Currently only Python is supported. As versions continue more languages will be added.
